# EvadeTheBoxes
A simple 3D FPP game made with the use of C++ and OpenGL.

The project uses SFML libraries to compile, and SFML .dll files to run. It should compile with the current project settings.

## Playing the game
You operate as a first-person character and focus not to hit any of the oncoming boxes from above, trying to beat your previous time with each crash.

Use WSAD keys to move.
Press K to begin the fall of the boxes.
Press Q or ALT+F4 while in-game to return to the main menu.

## Documentation
Further information about the project can be found in the attached report as the `Report.pdf` file.
